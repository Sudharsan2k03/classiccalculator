## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- ⚛️ React (Functional Components & Hooks)
- 🧠 JavaScript
- 💅 CSS (custom theming for light/dark modes)


💡 Usage
Click on number and operator buttons to create an expression.

Press = to evaluate the expression.

If the result matches a number in the predefined facts list, a fun fact will be displayed.

Press C to clear the expression and reset.

Use the 🌞/🌙 toggle button to switch between light and dark themes.

🧠 Fun Fact Logic
Facts are stored in an object (facts.js). If the result matches a key (like 42), the corresponding fun fact is shown. Otherwise, a generic "every number is cool!" message is displayed.
